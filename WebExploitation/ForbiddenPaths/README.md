## **Description:**
Can you get the flag? Here's the [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:52472/)[^1]. We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?


# **Write-Up:**
Lets start by taking a look at the website:  
  
  <img src='./images/website.png' width=1024>

  
It looks like we have a textbox with a button that will allow us to "read" a file.

../../../../flag.txt

and got the flag!
