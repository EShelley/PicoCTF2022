## **Description:**
The developer of this website mistakenly left an important artifact in the website source, can you find it? The website is here(http://saturn.picoctf.net:56849/)[^1]

# **Write-Up:**
Opened the site up in a browser and searched the main page for 'pico' first and nothing then searched 'flag' and found:
```html
            <!-- end slider section -->

            <!-- six_box
            end six_box   The flag is not here but keep digging :)-- >

            <!-- We Do Yogas -->
```  
Then checked the css/style.css file and found the flag:
```css
/** banner_main picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_ec95fa49} **/
```
# **FLAG:** 
```
picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_ec95fa49}
```
