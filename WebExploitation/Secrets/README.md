## **Description:**
We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag? The website is running [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:49810/)[^1].

# **Write-Up:**
Site:  
<img src='./images/site.png' width=1024>  

When nothing stuck out in the source code I decided to toss the site and gobuster and see what popped up. Doing so I traced down some hidden directories (lost origin output so recreated today):  

```bash
└─$ gobuster dir -u http://saturn.picoctf.net:50167/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt

```  

Opening that [directory](http://saturn.picoctf.net:49810/secret/)[^1] in a web browser got me this:  
<img src='./images/secret.png' width=1024>  

Looking at its source, in the 'Head' Tag, I saw a reference to hidden/file.css. So I then navigated to (http://saturn.picoctf.net:49810/secret/hidden/) [^1] and once again looking at the code I found a mention of superhidden/login.css:  
<img src='./images/hidden.png' width=1024>  
  

Rinse repeat with (http://saturn.picoctf.net:49810/secret/hidden/superhidden/) [^1]
<img src='./images/superhidden.png' width=1024>  
  
Now we can see the flag in the source code below, but another way to view the flag was to select all the test on the webpage:  
<img src='./images/flag.png' width=1024>  

  
# **FLAG:** 
```
picoCTF{succ3ss_@h3n1c@10n_08de81e4}
```
