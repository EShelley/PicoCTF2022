## **Description:**
Now you DONâ€™T see me. This [report](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/264/Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.pdf)[^1] [local](./Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.pdf) has some critical data in it, some of which have been redacted correctly, while some were not.<br> Can you find an important key that was not redacted properly?

Opening the pdf and selecting the text we find the flag:
